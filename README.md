# AI for tile-matching puzzle game
## Tile-matching game with Monte Carlo Tree Search AI

Matching tile games are an extremely popular game genre. They are simple to understand puzzle games, making them great for educational purposes. In this project, I propose the development of an artificial intelligence based on the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm (MCTS).

## Alternative approach

This is a non-deterministic game, however the stochastic component is manageable with minor modifications to the Min-Max. Among the variants of the Min-Max for stochastic games, consider, for example, the Expectiminimax algorithm.
Although it does not appear to be a 2-player game, the game is actually two-turn: in the first turn the human / artificial player exchanges two objects, in the second turn the opposing player eliminates 3 or more consecutive objects of the same type.
